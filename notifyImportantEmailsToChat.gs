/**
 * Function to check new filtered emails in Gmail and send real-time notifications to Google Chat.
 *
 * This script is designed to scan the Gmail inbox for unread emails under a specific label,
 * and then send those emails as notifications to a specified Google Chat room using a webhook.
 *
 * The script runs only on weekdays and during office hours (8 AM - 6 PM),
 * ensuring that you don't get notifications outside working hours.
 *
 * How it helps:
 * - Ideal for those who receive a high volume of corporate emails and only need to be notified about relevant emails.
 * - Automatically notifies important emails in real-time without overwhelming you with constant notifications.
